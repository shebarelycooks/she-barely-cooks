    <h1>Consent & Safety</h1>

    <p>
      This space is founded on <strong>mutual respect, trust, and informed consent.</strong>
      Every interaction within <em>Miss Dee's Kitchen</em> is created to be safe, voluntary,
      and enjoyable for all parties involved. Age verification is mandatory for Miss Dee to even consider
      engaging with anyone. Be prepared to provide valid age verification upon request.
    </p>

    <h3>Safe Words</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>ðŸŸ¡ <strong>Yellow</strong> â€” slow down, pause, or clarify.</li>
      <li>ðŸ”´ <strong>Red</strong> â€” stop immediately. Boundaries are to be respected without hesitation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Within any kink, even Findom, there are limitations for anyone. Miss Dee expects any potentiontial sub's limitations or boundaries <strong>discussed with Miss</strong>before
    continuing any sort of D/S relationship. If our interests do not align, there is a potential to be rejected as a sub. Serving Miss Dee is the biggest
    honor that you could have in your life. 
    <br>
    Please do not waste your chance to serve a <strong>true</strong> purpose.</p>

    <p>
      No illegal requests. No minors. No doxxing.
      <br>
      <strong>
        Tributes and financial interactions are voluntary gifts within a consensual dynamic â€”
        never obligations or requirements.
      </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      If at any point you feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed, you are encouraged to
      <strong>communicate clearly or step away.</strong>
      Your boundaries are always valid, and your safety comes first â€” inside and outside this kitchen.
